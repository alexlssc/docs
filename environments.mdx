We provide two public environments, Sandbox and Production:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card

    icon="gear"
  >
    A playground environment for you to test your API integration without having to worry about side effects.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Production"
    icon="circle-play"
  >
    Where your "real" data should live. Changes made there are propagated to publishers.
