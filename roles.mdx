description: 'Read this document to gain a better understanding of the various roles at Partoo and their capabilities.'
---

<Note>To use Partoo Rest API, you need an API Key ( [See Authentication section](/authentication) ). An API key authenticates a user and each user has a role.</Note>

A role defines for each resource (for instance user) a READ and/or WRITE access with the scope on which this access can be used.

For instance a user with Business Manager role has WRITE access on its own user and READ access to all the users of its organization.

For now there are 5 roles available:

| Role                  | Definition                                                                                                                             |
