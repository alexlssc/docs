    <h2>What is SSO?</h2>

    <p>
    <b>Single sign-on (SSO)</b> is an authentication method that allows users to
    access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.
    </p>


    <p>
    For Partoo, this means users can access the Partoo app directly from your
    application directory.
    </p>

    <p>
    SSO involves two parts:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
        The <b>Service</b> (the application you're connecting to, in this case,
        Partoo).
        </li>
        <li>
        The <b>Identity Provider</b> (the system managing users and logins, in
        this case, your system).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Partoo, as a <b>Service</b>, supports SSO connections using two protocols
    commonly supported by most Identity Providers (such as Google, Microsoft
    Azure Active Directory, Okta, etc.):
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>SAML</b></li>
        <li><b>OIDC</b> (OpenID Connect) with <b>PKCE flow</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    ⚠️ <b>Important: Our SSO functionality only allows connections to existing
    Partoo accounts.  It does not automatically create accounts.  You must
    create users beforehand, either through the Partoo API or the Partoo
    interface.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>How to set up SSO with Partoo?</h2>

    <h3>Step 1 – Enable the SSO features for your organization</h3>

    <p>
    To enable SSO for your organization on Partoo, first contact your Customer
    Success Manager.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2 – Retrieve required information from the Partoo App</h3>

    <p>
    After our team enables SSO for your organization, you can access the
    information needed to configure the connection with your identity provider.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the Partoo app, navigate to the SSO configuration page: <b>Settings</b> >
    <b>Integrations</b> > <b>SSO Connection</b> > <b>OIDC</b> or <b>SAML</b>,
    depending on your chosen protocol.
    </p>

    <p>
    This page will also be used in Step 4 to enter information from your
    identity provider.
    </p>

    <p>
    For the next step, you'll need the following information from this page:
    </p>

    <h4>For SAML</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>ACS URL</li>
      <li>Metadata URL</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For OIDC</h4>
    <il>
      <li>Redirect URL</li>
    </il>

    <h3>Step 3 – Add a Partoo application to your identity provider</h3>

    <p>
    In the endpoints below, <code>{identifier}</code> is a placeholder for the
    unique identifier of your SSO configuration. Newer configurations use UUIDs,
    while older ones may use a name like "your_enterprise_name". The formatted
    URLs can be found on the configuration page mentioned at the previous step.
    </p>

    <p>
    You will need to create a Partoo application in your Identity Provider using
    the following parameters:
    </p>

    <h4>For SAML</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>ACS URL: <code>https://app.partoo.co/api/v2/saml/{identifier}/acs</code>
        <li>Entity Id: <code>https://app.partoo.co/api/v2/saml/{identifier}/metadata/</code>
        <li>Attribute mapping: email => <code>email</code> or <code>urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3</code>
        <li>[optional] Allowed callback url: <code>https://app.partoo.co/api/v2/saml/{identifier}/acs</code>
    </ul>

    <h4>For OIDC</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Redirect URL: <code>https://app.partoo.co/connection?sso_alias={identifier}</code>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 4 – Add the connection information in the Partoo app</h3>

    <p>
    Once you've created the Partoo application in your Identity Provider,
    you'll need to configure the connection information in Partoo to finalise
    the setup.
    </p>

    <h4>For SAML</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Click the <b>Prefill</b> button in the banner and upload your
          <code>metadata.xml</code> file. The configuration will be extracted
          automatically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alternatively, you can manually fill in the following fields:
          <ul>
            <li>Entity ID</li>
            <li>Single Sign-on service</li>
            <li>X509 Certificate</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Regardless of which method you choose, you can also set:
          <ul>
            <li>An expiration date for your certificate or configuration.</li>
            <li>A technical contact email address.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For OIDC</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Click the <b>Prefill</b> button in the banner and enter your
          <code>.well-known</code> URL. Most of the configuration will be
          extracted automatically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alternatively, you can manually fill in the following fields:
          <ul>
            <li>Issuer</li>
            <li>Single Sign-on service</li>
            <li>Token endpoint</li>
            <li>JWKS URI</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
         Regardless of the method you choose, you must enter your
         <code>client_id</code> and, if required by your identity provider, your
         <code>client_secret</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 5 – Test the connection</h3>

    <p>
    Once the configuration is complete on both sides, you can test the login
    endpoint to initiate the SSO connection:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>For SAML: <code>https://app.partoo.co/api/v2/saml/{identifier}/login</code>
        <li>For OIDC: <code>https://app.partoo.co/api/v2/oidc/{identifier}/login</code>
    </ul>

    <p>
    You can also log in via SSO from the
    <a href="https://app.partoo.co/connection/sso">Partoo connection page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h3>How can we create users?</h3>
        Users cannot be created automatically with the SSO. They need to be created manually through the app or the API.
        See <a href="https://developers.partoo.co/rest_api/v2/#operation/createUser">API User creation</a>
      <h3>How to create an SSO only user?</h3>
        To create a user with SSO only, you need to send <code>sso_only = True</code>, <code>send_invitation=False</code> and no <code>password</code> in the creation call.
      <h3>What should I do when my certificate expires?</h3>
        Your generated certificates have an expiration date.
        You will be reminded to update them by email (on the technical contact provided) before the certificate expires.
        You can follow the email instructions, which will ask you to send a new certificate to the given email address.
      <h3>Can I use other methods to log in on the connection page?</h3>
        Sure, for example, if you use Google as an Identity Provider, you can use the Google login.
