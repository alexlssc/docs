    Conversations happens between a Business and a consumer that wants to get
    in touch with the business.

    A Consumer can reach out to the business on one of the supported messaging
    channels (Google, Facebook, Instagram, SMS). It will then create a new
    Conversation.

    ⚠️ When dealing with `Instagram` conversations, there are some requirements that you have to follow :
    - You must not store consumer media (images, stories, ...). You can store
    the media URL, but not it's content.
    - If you store conversation messages, you must also implement the
    [Message Deleted](#operation/message_deleted) webhook. When a
    Message Deleted event is received, you
    must delete the stored content of the message.

- name: Reviews
  description: |
    <b>⚠️ This feature is available only for businesses subscribed to Review Management. ⚠️</b>

    Partoo centralises all businesses reviews from Google, Facebook and TripAdvisor platforms.

    The reviews are fetched once per day (over night), therefore a it is expected to have a delay of maximum 24h.
    The Partoo APIs enable a simple way of replying to any new reviews, update an existing reply or delete a reply.
    A review can have one of the following status:
    - `treated`: has a reply/comment or it was manually marked as treated in the Partoo UI
    - `not-treated`: it doesn't have a reply/comment and it was not manually marked as treated in the Partoo UI
    - `deleted`: the review was removed by the user on the original platfrom.

    **Note:** the review itself cannot be altered nor deleted via the APIs.

    Reply templates allow business managers to gain time in replying to the reviews,
    via a predefined answer which can be easily selected and sent.

    Reply templates are not meant to be used outside the Partoo application.
    For this reason it is not possible to access a _formatted_ template, with prefilled placeholders from the API.

    However it is still possible to browse through, create or delete reply templates from the Partoo API.
