  <h2>Rate Limiting</h2>
  In order to keep service available for everyone, our APIs are protected using a Rate Limit.

  Each organization is limited to <b>300 calls per minute</b> by default.
  If your integration requires more calls for any reason, get in touch with your customer success to update this limit, with review from our Tech team.

  Any call beyond the reached limit will result in an error with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429">status code 429</a>.
  A http header <code>Retry-After</code> is added to the response to hint when a query can be retried (60s later).
