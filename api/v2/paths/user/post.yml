summary: Create user
description: >
  This endpoint lets you create a user. If no password given, a password will automatically be generated.
  
  
  The password will be ignored if `send_invitation` is set to `True`.
  
  
  You need to have `WRITE` access on the organization of the user you want to create.
  
  
  If you want to have an `invited` user but send the invitation email later, you have to send the `send_invitation` parameter as `False` and a `status` parameter to `invited`.<br />
  You will then have to call the <a href="#operation/reinviteUser">invitation endpoint</a> to send the invitation email to the user.
