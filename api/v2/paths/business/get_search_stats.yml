summary: Get completion rate stats from your businesses
description: >
  This endpoint works in the same way as the [operation/searchBusinesses](https://developers.partoo.co/rest_api/v2/#operation/searchBusinesses) endpoint, but instead of returning data on all returned businesses,
  this endpoint returns completion rate statistics aggregated across all businesses.


  The statistics returned are the average completion rate for all businesses that fit the given filters, as well as the count of businesses with a low, medium, and high respectively.
  The thresholds for low, medium, and high can be found below in the response details.


  Note that this endpoint works in the exact same way as [operation/searchBusinesses](https://developers.partoo.co/rest_api/v2/#operation/searchBusinesses) (with the exception of parameters that format the output, such as <code>order_by</code> and pagination), but the return value is different.
