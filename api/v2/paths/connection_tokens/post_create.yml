summary: Generate connection token
description: >
  This endpoint lets you generate a connection token to authenticate a user without having to indicate its credentials.
  To be able to generate a connection token for a user, you need to have `WRITE` access on that user and that user
  cannot have `PROVIDER` role.
  A connection token is valid only once and has a time to live of maximum one day.
