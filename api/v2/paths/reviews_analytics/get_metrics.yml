 This endpoint lets you view the statistics related to reviews made to your businesses subscribed to
  **Review Management**.

  A request is composed of:
  - One or more `metrics` which is the data you want to return
  - An optional `dimensions` which defines how the data is grouped by
    - If it is omitted, the request will return the metrics over all the data, based on your filters
  - An optional `order_by` to define how the data is sorted
  - Filters, the data can be filtered by:
    - Businesses
    - Groups
    - Tags
    - Review update date

  Here is the list of all **metrics** available:
  - `average_rating`: Average rating
  - `rating_distribution`: Breakdown of the ratings (Number of 1-star reviews, 2-star reviews, 3-star reviews, etc...)
  - `reviews_count`: Number of reviews received
  - `reply_time`: Breakdown of the reviews based on how fast (less or more than 48 hours) they have been replied to (or not replied)
  - `reply_means`: Breakdown of the review replies based on the reply method used (manual reply, reply template, auto reply or AI suggestion)
  - `average_rating_distribution`: Breakdown of your businesses based on their average rating
  - `rank`: Allows you to rank the users, businesses or groups based on their performance on a metric (an order_by is required)

  Here is the list of all **dimensions** available, and for each of them, the list of metrics and sort order available:
  - No dimension
    - This allows you to get global stats across all your businesses
    - Available metrics: `average_rating`, `rating_distribution`, `reviews_count`, `reply_time`, `reply_means`, `average_rating_distribution`
  - Date dimensions: `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`
    - This allows you to get the evolution of your metrics over time
    - Available metrics: `average_rating`, `rating_distribution`, `reviews_count`, `reply_time`, `reply_means`
  - Business and business group dimensions: `business`, `group`
    - This allows you to see the metrics business by business or group by group (Requires group filter)
    - Available metrics: `average_rating`, `rating_distribution`, `reviews_count`, `reply_time`, `reply_means`, `rank`
  - `user`
    - This allows you to see the metrics user by user
    - Available metrics: `reply_time`, `reply_means`, `rank`
  - `tag`
    - This allows you to see the metrics tag by tag
    - Available metrics: `average_rating`, `rating_distribution`, `reviews_count`

  Here is the list of all **order_by** available (Add a minus `-` sign before to order by decreasing order):
  - `average_rating`: Sort by average rating
  - `reviews_count`: Sort by review_count
  - `reply_time__total`: Sort by number of reviews received
  - `reply_means__total`: Sort by number of reviews that have been replied
  - `ratio__rating_distribution__5`: Sort by the ratio of 5 star reviews
  - `ratio__rating_distribution__negative`: Sort by the ratio of negative reviews
  - `ratio__reply_time__fast`: Sort by the ratio of reviews replied in less than 2 days
  - `ratio__reply_time__slow`: Sort by the ratio of reviews replied in more than 2 days
  - `ratio__reply_time__not_replied`: Sort by the ratio of reviews not replied
  - `ratio__reply_means__manual`: Sort by the ratio reviews replied manually
  - `ratio__reply_means__ai_suggestion`: Sort by the ratio reviews replied using AI suggestion
  - `ratio__reply_means__reply_template`: Sort by the ratio reviews replied using reply template
  - `ratio__reply_means__auto_reply`: Sort by the ratio reviews replied using auto reply

  To use an **order_by** parameter, its corresponding metric must be included in the request.
  (i.e.
  to order by `average_rating`, you must include the `average_rating` metric in the `metrics` parameter,
  to order by `ratio__rating_distribution__5`, you must include the `rating_distribution` metric in the `metrics` parameter,
  and so on...)
