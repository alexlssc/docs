summary: Fetch Google Location Verification Options
description: >
  This endpoint retrieves verification options for a specific Google location identified by `google_location_id`. It 
  requires authentication and authorization to access. The user must have at least the role of a `BUSINESS_MANAGER` to use this
  endpoint.
  
  
  Note that the response can return an empty options list, this can mean two things:
     - There are really no verification options available for this location.
     - Video verification is possible but not implemented through the API. In this case, you should ask the user to manually verify.
