description: >
  This endpoint lets you delete an organization.
  You need to have `WRITE` access on your provider.
  When an organization gets deleted all the resources linked to it are deleted (users and businesses).
  If the organization still has businesses or users,
  it would raise an error if you do not indicate `force="True"` in the JSON body.
