summary: Create a post
description: |
  This endpoint lets you create a post or a draft post on Google / Facebook / Instagram.
  
  The creation of a post will not happen in real time and might take a few minutes.
  
  A draft post can only be created by Org Admins and is not immediately published. 
  An expiration date must be specified when creating a draft post.
  In order to be published, a draft needs to be updated by a BM/GM user before the expiration date.
