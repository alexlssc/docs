operationId: listConversations
description: |
  This endpoint lets you list all the Conversations you have access to.

  You can filter the conversations based on the Organization or the Business
  that they are related to.

  If you want to keep an up-to-date list of ongoing conversations for your
  businesses, we recommend using the [Message Received](#operation/message_received) and
  [Message Deleted](#operation/message_deleted) Webhooks instead of periodically calling this endpoint.

  ⚠️ This endpoint is paginated using cursor pagination. This means that in
  order to get the next page of results, you need to provide the cursor
  returned in the previous call.
