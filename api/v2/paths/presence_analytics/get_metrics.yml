summary: Profile metrics for your business
description: |
  This endpoint lets you view the **Google Business Profile** analytics for all your businesses subscribed to
  **Presence Management**.
  The API allows you to select what data you're interested in, and how you want it aggregated (daily, monthly,
  by business, etc). You can also filter the results to limit it to a certain date range, and to certain business.

  Google Business Profile doesn't provide reliable data for the most recent 5 days.

  You can choose the analytics you want to get among:
  - impressions: desktop maps impressions, mobile maps impressions, desktop search impressions, and mobile search impressions
  - actions: website link clicks, phone calls, and driving directions

  You can use the following filters:
  - by businesses (businesses id in list or not in list)
  - by date (analytics before and/or after a date)
  - by business query. Will return matches for the business name, zipcode or city
  - by business city.

  The response can be aggregated by:
  - business id
  - by date: either by day, week, month or year
  - by both business id and date

  The response can be ordered in ascending or descending order by any of the selected dimensions or metrics.
  See examples for more details.
