summary: Profile keywords for your business
description: |
  This endpoint lets you view the monthly **Google Business Profile** search keywords for all your businesses subscribed to Presence Management.

  To access the analytics of a business, you need to:
  - have `READ` access on it
  - have subscribed to **Presence Management** for this business.
  - You can access the search keywords from **Google Business Profile**.

  The analytics on search keywords are made available by Google Business Profile on a monthly basis.

  You will receive the following metrics:

  - count: The sum of the number of unique users that used the keyword in a month
  - threshold: A threshold value indicating that the actual value is less than the threshold. Google Business Profile typically displays for search keywords that were used less than 15 times in a month.

  You can use the following filters:

  - by businesses (businesses id in list, and restricted to one business when using the keyword dimension.)
  - by date (analytics before and/or after a date)

  The response can be aggregated by:
  - business id
  - by date: month or year
  - both business id and date

  The response can be ordered by:

  - business id
  - by date: month, or year

  The response can be ordered in ascending or descending order by any of the selected dimensions or metrics.
