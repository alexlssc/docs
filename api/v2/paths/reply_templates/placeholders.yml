summary: All available placeholders
description: |
  This endpoint lets you access available placeholders for reply review templates.
  A template placeholder is a dynamically updated word within the Partoo app depending on the context.

  Ex: Once used to answer a review, if a template has a `client_first_name` placeholder, the placeholder will take the value of the reviewer's first name.
