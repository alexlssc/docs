summary: Send a review invitation
operationId: sendReviewInvitation
description: >
  This endpoint lets you send a SMS to a costumer to help him leave a message on Google.
  You need to have `WRITE` access on the business.
  You can add "invite_content" in your payload to customize the SMS content that will be received by the recipient. Else, the template associated with the user will be used (see <a href="#tag/Review-Booster/paths/~1review_booster~1template/get">/v2/review_booster/template</a> for more info).
  If no template exist, a new one will be generated.
  <p>Your business needs to be connected to a Google location and to be subscribed to Review Booster product.
  So this cannot be tested in Sandbox Env.
  To prevent spamming, a new SMS can be sent to a specific phone number only after 10 days since the last SMS sent.
