summary: Message Updated
description: |
  This event is triggered if the field of a message is updated (example: `status`, `is_deleted`).

  Messages send via Partoo are created with the status `Sending`, and
  propagated to the messaging channel.
  If the message is sent successfully, the status is changed to `Success`.
  If the messaging channel fails to send the message, the status changed to
  `Failed`. A failed message can be retried using the [/retry endpoint](#operation/retrySendMessage).

  The event payload contains the event type, the content of the updated message and additional information about the conversation.
