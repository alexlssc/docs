      type: object
      description: |
        Specifies the exact field within a business section, like 'open_hours' or 'description_short', where the error was detected. This allows for pinpointing specific areas within business information that require attention.
      additionalProperties:
        type: string
        description: |
          A mapping of publisher names to their corresponding error identifiers for the given field. Each key in this object is a publisher's name, and its value is a string representing a unique error code or message key, such as 'name_has_more_than_90_char' for overly long names or 'description_short_too_long' for descriptions exceeding allowable length. This structure supports detailing multiple errors across various publishers for a single business information field.
